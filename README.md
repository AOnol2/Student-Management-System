# Student Management System

## Project Overview
The **Student Management System** is a C++ console application designed to manage student records. This project demonstrates key C++ concepts, including object-oriented programming, file handling, and data management. Users can add, search, display, update, and delete student records through a simple text-based interface.

## Features
1. **Add New Student**: Collects and stores details such as student ID, name, age, grade, and address.
2. **Display All Students**: Lists all student records currently stored.
3. **Search Student by ID** (Optional for future development): Finds and displays a studentâ€™s record based on a unique ID.
4. **Update Student Record** (Optional for future development): Allows modifications to existing student information.
5. **Delete Student Record** (Optional for future development): Removes a student's record from the file.

## Code Structure
- `student_management.cpp`: Main program file containing the code for the application.
- `students.txt`: File where student records are stored.
  
## How to Run the Program
### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (such as `g++`)

### Compilation
To compile the program, use the following command in your terminal:
```bash
g++ student_management.cpp -o student_management
